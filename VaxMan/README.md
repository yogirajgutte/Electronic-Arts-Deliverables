### Vaxman in Python with PyGame

Vaxman is a game based on Pacman. Following are rules of Vaxman:
  1. Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
  2. Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
  3. Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
  4. The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
